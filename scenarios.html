    <h1><a name="ukcollege"></a>Scenario 01 - You’re a UK college...</h1>
    <p><img src="/assets/images/ukcollege.jpg"
            style="float: right; width: 40%; height: auto; border-radius: 15px; margin-left: 15px; border: 2px solid #e56b14; "/>You’re
        a UK college, you have a IT team of around 5 people, who are responsible for the entire IT estate. You know
        you’d like to take advantage of a series of Cloud services protected by your institutional single sign on
        system, as well as giving your students easy off campus access to e-resources; but your team is swamped and have
        no capacity to trouble shoot the setup of these new services.</p>
    <p>We can help by remotely managing your IDP and working with your cloud service suppliers to bring new services
        inline in a timely fashion. We can also handle security patching work so the core of your authentication
        infrastructure is secure.</p>

    <h1><a name="digitaldesignagency"></a>Scenario 02 - You're a digital design agency...</h1>
    <p><img src="/assets/images/designagency.jpg"
            style="float: left; width: 40%; height: auto; border-radius: 15px; margin-right: 15px; border: 2px solid #e56b14; "/>You're
        a digital design agency; you’ve got a service you want to sell to higher education organisations but they keep
        asking for this ‘shibboleth’ thing. Your guys have had a bit of a look and are struggling to get your device
        integrated, meanwhile you feel your losing the opportunity to make the sale.</p>
    <p>We can help by working with your tech guys to add Shibboleth auth to your app and advising you on how to make the
        integration process as easy as possible for your customers.</p>

    <h1><a name="cloudservice"></a>Scenario 03 - Maybe you want to use a low cost or free cloud service...</h1>
    <p><img src="/assets/images/cloudservice.jpg"
            style="float: right; width: 40%; height: auto; border-radius: 15px; margin-left: 15px; border: 2px solid #e56b14; "/>Maybe
        you want to use a low cost or free cloud service, you can see they offer SAML on their sales literature, but
        you’re having trouble getting it to work, the amount of support you’re getting from the cloud service is limited
        and you’ve run out of ideas.</p>
    <p>We can help, with lots of experience integrating with a range of SAML service providers we can quickly identify
        problems and either rectify them, or liaise with 3rd parties to resolve the issue at their end.</p>

    <h1><a name="biginstitution"></a>Scenario 04 - You’re a big institution...</h1>
    <p><img src="/assets/images/biginstitution.jpg"
            style="float: left; width: 40%; height: auto; border-radius: 15px; margin-right: 15px; border: 2px solid #e56b14; "/>You’re
        a big institution. You already have an authentication infrastructure, in fact you have a lot of them. You want
        to remover the duplication and get everything working together and you want help planning your road map.</p>
    <p>We can help by looking at how your services and already used and the integrations between them and offering
        advice on how to move to the estate that you want, as well as highlighting oppertunities available to you in an
        impartial manner.</p>

    <h1><a name="doingwell"></a>Scenario 05 - You’re doing pretty well on Shibboleth and SAML...</h1>
    <p><img src="/assets/images/mobilewheat.jpg"
            style="float: right; width: 40%; height: auto; border-radius: 15px; margin-left: 15px; border: 2px solid #e56b14; "/>You’re
        doing pretty well on Shibboleth and SAML. You’ve got a person looking after that role, they seem to be getting
        on with the work OK. Certainly you don’t seem to have the sorts of problems others tell you about. But you
        wonder about cover if that person is ill or leaves. We can help by acting as a backup point of contact.</p>
